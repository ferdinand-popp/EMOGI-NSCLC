    This method constructs a vector y and a mask m from some indices given.
    Both returned vectors will be boolean and have shape (n,). y will
    contain 1 at positions where the corresponding node in the GCN is positive
    (disease gene) and mask will contain 1 at positions of the indices.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    y:                  The targets for all nodes
    mask:               The mask for all known nodes

                        All elements of indices must be in the range (0, y.shape)

    second contains the corresponding mask.

    from the complete mask and targets. The proportion of nodes used
    for validation is determined by `val_size`.
    The split will be stratified and the returned arrays have the

    Parameters:
    ----------

    Constructs four different sets for k different folds. The four sets
    are all boolean vectors of length n, where n is the number of nodes
    in the GCN and the shape of y and mask.
    The four sets per fold are training labels, testing labels, training
    mask and testing mask, respectively.
    The sets are splitted in a stratified manner, for instance in a 5-fold
    CV, there should be 1/5 of all the positives in the test set.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    y:                  The targets/labels for all nodes. y has to be a
                        binary vector and contain a 1 for positive nodes

                        containing a 1 for all nodes that are labelled
                        (no matter if positive or negative).
                        y and mask have to have the same first dimension.
    folds:              The number of folds to split the data to, i.e. k

    Returns:
    A list of length `folds` or k. Each of the elements in the list is a tuple
